## Affected products

We have not yet tested Asus models other than those listed. However we suspect it may also work on other models with similar firmware version higher than 2.0.0.

```
    Technicolor 789vac v2
```



## Overview

An issue was discovered in the Technicolor 789vac router running firmware AGTOT 2.2.3. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted probe or perform a service detection scan, targeting the iperf service on port 5001. This triggers an immediate failure in the routerâ€™s network stack, causing disruption of all network connectivity (wired and wireless) and resulting in a full router reboot.

**This PoC can result in a DoS.**

**Given the vendor's policies, we wont't show the Source Code of the binary scripts. However, we'll inspect the web page source. We'll provide the insights before and after the procedure.**
