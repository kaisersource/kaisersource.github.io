## Affected products

We have not yet tested Asus models other than those listed. However we suspect it may also work on other models with the same firmware version.

```
    DSL-N14U_B1 V.1.1.2.3_805
    
```




## Overview

An issue was discovered on ASUS DSL-N14U-B1 1.1.2.3_805 device. Remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash) by performing a SYN scan using a tool such as nmap. Sending these packets causes a persistent outage of the jetdirect (9100/tcp), LPD (515/tcp) and sos (3838/udp) services. 

## POC

**This PoC can crash services.**

**Given the vendor's security, we don't show the service execution flow, however we will explain the vulnerability in a comprehensive way.**


We enter the router via ssh to understand through the proc file system what happens.

Come mostrato in figura, possiamo notare dei servizi attivi e la loro porta in formato esadecimale.
Quelli che ci interessano sono sostanzialmente 515 (jetdirect) nonch√© 0203, 
e 515 (LPD) che corrisponde a 238C in esadecimale.

We run nmap by inserting a relatively intrusive script. As reported by the nmap website (https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html), the more intrusive a script is, the more it engages the services until they crash (as in this case).

`nmap -sV --script pjl-ready-message -p 9100 <IP>`

Once this is done, we will immediately notice differences in the proc file system.

As a counter check, we show the status of services before and after running nmap via `netstat -tulen`
(busybox doesn't support -p, which is why we work on the proc file system inside the router).

We also check if there have been other local services not visible to the firewall policies that have been compromised. To make it easier to understand, let's compare the two images.

![](/assets/asus_2/tcp_udp_all_after.png)

If you have had an eye previously, you have seen well, three occurrences are to be eliminated ...
Another service crashed ... sos service (3838 / tcp) - Scito Object Server

The situation will persist as long as the modem router is active. The services will be active again only with a physical intervention (reboot)


<!--
#Dato il contesto limitante di un ambiente come quello di un router, vi consiglio per "abbellire" il formato del proc file system da questo articolo https://staaldraad.github.io/2017/12/20/netstat-without-netstat/). -->
